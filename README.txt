For our final project we have created a game where the player declares war on their opponent and strikes at them with the mighty paper airplane. You must select the type of airplane you would like to throw. After making your selection you will throw your airplane at your opponent with your chosen pitch, yaw, and power (warning: they will attempt to dodge your throw). Your opponent will be firing on you as well so you have to be sure to use your controls to dodge incoming planes. You have three lives, if you lose them all you lose the war.

Controls:

  - Left mouse click -> selecting plane
  - Space bar -> pick your pitch, yaw, and power
  - On your turn:
  	- Left arrow key -> blow plane to the left while in flight
  	- Right arrow key  -> blow plane to the right while in flight
  	- Up arrow key -> blow plane up while in flight
  	- Down arrow key -> blow plane down while in flight
	- s -> rotate your view down
 	- w -> rotate your view up
  	- a -> rotate your view left
  	- d -> rotate your view right
  - On opponent's turn:
    	- Left arrow key -> moves your character left
  	- Right arrow key  -> moves your character right
  - r -> reset the game
  - q/esc -> exit
