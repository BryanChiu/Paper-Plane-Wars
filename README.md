For our final project we have created a game where the player declares war on their oppenent and strikes at them with the mighty paper airplane. After moving on from the welcome page, you must select the type of airplane you would like to throw. After making your selection you will throw your airplane at your opponent (warning: they will attempt to dodge your throw). Your opponent will be firing on you as well so you have to be sure to use your controls to dodge incoming planes as well. Your hearts represent your life, if you lose all three you lose the game.

Controls:
Left mouse button - selecting (planes, throwing, etc)
Right arrow key - move your character to the right
Left arrow key - move your character to the left
Up arrow key - make your character 'jump'
Down arrow key - make your character 'duck'
m - move your character forward
n - move your character backward
q - exit
esc - exit
s - rotate your view down
w - rotate your view up
a - rotate your view left
d - rotate your view right
r - reset the game
space bar - pick your pitch, yaw, and power

From the list of additions to choose from we have included:
  - None geometric primitives [10%]
  - lighting [5%]
  - textures [10%]
  - animated characters [5%]
  - camera control [10%]
  - picking [10%]
  - and our own idea (plane control) [5-10%]
